- Box will animate off screen if moved past a threshold
- If let go before reaching threshold, it will snap back to the center.
- box will rotate right or left as you drag based on where you "grab" the box
- box will fade as you get closer to the side of the screen
- you can also swipe the box left or right to remove it.
